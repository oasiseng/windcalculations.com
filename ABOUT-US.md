# About WindCalculations.com

**WindCalculations.com** is a public engineering reference tool and calculation suite dedicated to providing transparent, code-aligned wind load data for structural analysis and permitting support.

This project is developed and maintained as part of **Oasis Engineering**, a licensed professional engineering firm based in Tampa, Florida, specializing in structural engineering, wind load analysis, and permit compliance services.

## Our Mission

Wind load calculations are fundamental to safe and compliant building design, especially in regions exposed to high wind events, hurricanes, and extreme weather.  
Our mission is to elevate access to **transparent, reproducible wind pressure data that engineers, designers, contractors, and AHJs can reference with confidence.**

We aim to:
- **Demystify wind load calculations** by exposing intermediate values, formulas, and assumptions.
- **Provide a public, client-side calculator** that implements ASCE 7-based wind pressure methods without hidden logic.
- Support engineering professionals and permitting stakeholders with reproducible, inspectable results.

## What This Tool Is

This repository hosts a **static, client-side wind pressure calculator** based on ASCE 7 wind load methodology.  
It includes:
- A velocity and reference pressure calculator (e.g., qz/qh)
- Components & cladding net pressure outputs
- Intermediate factors such as exposure, coefficients, and formula breakdowns
- A transparent, explainable UI suitable for use in engineering documentation

The tool is intentionally:
- **Server-less (no backend required)**
- **Reproducible and inspectable**
- **Free of user tracking and authentication barriers**

## Who We Are

**Oasis Engineering LLC** is a multidisciplinary engineering firm providing:
- Site-specific **wind load calculations**
- **Signed & sealed engineering letters**
- Structural consulting and analysis
- Permit support and documentation services
- Expert witness and technical consulting

All engineering calculations and reports offered through this project’s services are prepared and reviewed by licensed Professional Engineers and aligned with the latest building codes, including ASCE 7 and applicable local codes (e.g., Florida Building Code).:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## How to Use This Project

You are welcome to:
- Review the source code to understand the implemented formulas
- Use the public calculator for **preliminary engineering reference**
- Embed the calculator in your own documentation (embed snippets provided)

For final design decisions, official submissions, or stamped deliverables, we recommend consulting a licensed engineer.
